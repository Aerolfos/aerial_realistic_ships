[h3]Updated for 3.4.[/h3]

[h3]Not achievement compatible.[/h3]

Since Realistic Ships was not updated for when I wanted to play with it, I decided to do it myself. In the process, I came across small issues, unnecessary overwrites, and balance issues. So now after way too much effort the mod is now (mostly) properly updated.

This mod features 6 new ship classes:

[list]
    [*] Support Cruisers
    [*] Electronic Attack Cruisers
    [*] Battlecruisers
	[*] Fleet Carriers
	[*] Dreadnoughts
	[*] Heavy Dreadnoughts
[/list]

These ships double down on the vanilla counters:

[list]
    [*] Small ships beat large artillery ships
    [*] Carriers beat small ships
    [*] Artillery ships beat carriers
[/list]

In order to help facilitate this, the H slot sections were removed from battleships, so cruisers (refitted to light carriers) and full fleet carriers are the only source of strike craft.

In return, battleships got new sections, for example missiles are now actually usable on larger ships. PD also appears on larger ships, which helps counter strike craft dominance.

Battlecruisers specifically can be kitted out with full PD or S, allowing them to serve both a picket role in capital fleets, and a flagship role in non-capital fleets.

Not sure what to do about Heavy Dreadnoughts, so they also have PD and S slots since a giant flagship rushing into a horde of corvettes and tearing them up with autocannon spam is hilarious. PD makes them scary fleet anchors for carriers.

[u]Destroyers and battleships are overwritten to make new sections.[/u]

[u]This mod should be compatible with most stuff by avoiding most overwrites. Non-vanilla shipsets will get fallback mammalian models though, for obvious reasons.[/u]

Note that for the moment some sections are missing kitbashes and proper turret placements. Also no aquatics support, I don't own aquatics.

As written, "Lastly, If you are going to create a separate mod/patch, feel free to use the concepts I used in this mod as mentioned in my readme above. All I ask is to give credit where it is due." This is not a true continuation of the original mod, nor intended to replace it.
