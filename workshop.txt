Since Realistic Ships was not updated for when I wanted to play with it, I decided to do it myself. In the process, I came across small issues, unnecessary overwrites, and balance issues. So now after way too much effort the mod is now (mostly) properly updated.

This mod features 6 new ship classes:

[list]
    [*] Support Cruisers
    [*] Electronic Warfare Cruisers
    [*] Battlecruisers
	[*] Fleet Carriers
	[*] Lanceships
	[*] Guardian Ships
[/list]

(WIP)

These ships double down on the vanilla counters:

[list]
    [*] Small ships beat large artillery ships
    [*] Carriers beat small ships
    [*] Artillery ships beat carriers
[/list]

In order to help facilitate this, the H slot sections were removed from battleships, so cruisers (refitted to light carriers) and full fleet carriers are the only source of strike craft.

In return, battleships got new sections, for example missiles are now actually usable on larger ships. PD also appears on larger ships, which helps counter strike craft dominance.

Battlecruisers specifically can be kitted out with full PD or S, allowing them to serve both a picket role in capital fleets, and a flagship role in non-capital fleets.

Not sure what to do about Heavy Dreadnoughts, so they also have PD and S slots since a giant flagship rushing into a horde of corvettes and tearing them up with autocannon spam is hilarious. PD makes them scary fleet anchors for carriers.

[u]Destroyers and battleships are overwritten to make new sections.[/u] See [url=https://github.com/Aerolfos/aerial_realistic_ships/wiki/Developer-Information]Github documentation[/url] for a detailed list of overwrites.

[u]This mod should be compatible with many mods by avoiding most overwrites. Shipsets not explicitly supported will get fallback mammalian models for the ship classes added by this mod, for obvious reasons.[/u]

Graphics stuff is not yet finished, missing sections and ships. Full toxoid and newer shipsets missing.

[u]Currently Supported Shipsets:[/u]
[list]
    [*] Arthropoid
    [*] Avian
    [*] Fungoid
    [*] Humanoid
    [*] Lithoid
    [*] Mammalian
    [*] Molluscoid
    [*] Necroid
    [*] Nemesis (Imperial)
    [*] Plantoid
    [*] Reptilian
    [*] Toxoid
    [*] - Modded Shipsets -
    [*] Machine Shipset
    [*] Sins of the Prophets (UNSC and Covenant)
    [*] United Fleet Shipset
[/list]
