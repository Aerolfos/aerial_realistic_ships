[h3]Updated for 3.6.[/h3]

[h3]Not achievement compatible.[/h3]

Since Realistic Ships was not updated for when I wanted to play with it, I decided to do it myself. In the process, I came across small issues, unnecessary overwrites, and balance issues. So now after way too much effort the mod is now (mostly) properly updated.

This mod features 6 new ship classes:

[list]
    [*] Support Cruisers
    [*] Electronic Attack Cruisers
    [*] Battlecruisers
	[*] Fleet Carriers
	[*] Dreadnoughts
	[*] Heavy Dreadnoughts
[/list]

These ships double down on the vanilla counters:

[list]
    [*] Small ships beat large artillery ships
    [*] Carriers beat small ships
    [*] Artillery ships beat carriers
[/list]

In order to help facilitate this, the H slot sections were removed from battleships, so cruisers (refitted to light carriers) and full fleet carriers are the only source of strike craft.

3.6 balance is still being figured out. 

Larger ships have PD sections to help screen fleets. They have some torpedo slots for now, and M slots to fit the new missiles. The dreadnought and battleship remain pretty rigid in their fitting still, and should serve purely as artillery ships.

Battlecruisers are the flexible choice, just like cruisers, allowing them to serve both a support role in capital fleets, and a flagship role in non-capital fleets.

Heavy Dreadnoughts are mostly artillery ships, but can also be fitted out as a pure screen vessel, serving as a fleet anchor coated in ungodly amounts of dakka.

Support cruisers provide powerful buff auras for your fleets, like adding one disengagement chance to the fleet or shield-hardening to nearby ships. However, they are vulnerable and lightly armed compared to cruisers.

Electronic Attack Cruisers instead debuff your enemies, like reducing their range and speed or providing negative shield hardening. An enemy support cruiser will cancel out the effect, but otherwise all shots will deal chip damage that bypasses shields.

[u]Destroyers and battleships are overwritten to make new sections.[/u]

[u]This mod should be compatible with most stuff by avoiding most overwrites. Non-vanilla shipsets will get fallback mammalian models though, for obvious reasons.[/u]

Graphics stuff is not yet finished, missing sections and ships.

[u]Currently Supported Shipsets:[/u]

    [*] Arthropoid

As written, "Lastly, If you are going to create a separate mod/patch, feel free to use the concepts I used in this mod as mentioned in my readme above. All I ask is to give credit where it is due." This is not a true continuation of the original mod, nor intended to replace it.
